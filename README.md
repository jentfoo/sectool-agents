# go-appsec/sectool-agents

[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/go-appsec/toolbox/blob/main/LICENSE)

Agents that drive [`sectool`](https://github.com/go-appsec/toolbox) in autonomous security workflows. Each agent runs a multi-agent loop (workers + verifier + director) on top of sectool's MCP server so an LLM can autonomously explore a target for vulnerabilities, reproduce candidates, and file findings.

This repo is a home for multiple agent implementations. They all share the same agent contract (worker reports candidates, verifier reproduces and files, director plans the next iteration) — what differs is which SDK / model backend the agent runs on and which language it's written in.

## Prerequisites

Every agent in this repo drives `sectool`, which lives in the [go-appsec/toolbox](https://github.com/go-appsec/toolbox) repo and must be installed independently:

```bash
go install github.com/go-appsec/toolbox/sectool@latest
```

This places the `sectool` binary on your `GOBIN` (typically `$GOPATH/bin` or `~/go/bin`). Make sure that directory is on your `PATH`, or pass the binary path to the agent via its own flag — see each agent's README.

See the individual agent READMEs for any additional language / runtime prerequisites (e.g. Python, Node, etc.).

## Available agents

| Agent | Language | Backend | Auth |
|-------|----------|---------|------|
| [`claude-controller/`](claude-controller/) | Python | Claude Agent SDK | Claude Code OAuth (uses your `claude` CLI session) |

### [`claude-controller/`](claude-controller/)

[![Vibe-Scale 4: AI-generated, behavior validated](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vibe--Scale%204-AI--generated%2C%20behavior%20validated-ff7f0e)](https://github.com/go-appsec/vibe-scale/blob/main/README.md)

A Python controller built on the Claude Agent SDK. Workers run as Claude Code instances connected to sectool's MCP server; the verifier and director are separate Claude instances with phase-gated tool surfaces and their own system prompts.

Use `claude-controller` if:

- You already pay for a Claude subscription via Claude Code and want to bill autonomous security exploration to that quota directly, without managing a separate API key.
- You want the sharpest currently-available Claude models as workers and orchestrators with zero extra provider setup.

See [`claude-controller/README.md`](claude-controller/README.md) for installation, flag reference, phase mechanics, and test instructions.

## Shared architecture

- **Workers** call sectool MCP tools (proxy, replay, crawl, OAST, diff/reflection, encoders) plus a `report_finding_candidate` tool.
- **Verifier** is a separate agent with the full sectool tool surface whose only job is to independently reproduce candidates, then call `file_finding` or `dismiss_candidate`.
- **Director** is a separate agent whose only job is to decide what each worker does next: `continue_worker`, `expand_worker`, `stop_worker`, `plan_workers`, or `done`. It also sets each worker's per-iteration `autonomous_budget`.
- The outer loop runs **autonomous worker turns → verification → direction** per iteration, with phase-gated tools so each role stays in lane.
- Findings are deduplicated and written as markdown files with a Verification section in the configured findings directory.

## Where findings land

Every agent writes to its `--findings-dir` (default `./findings/`) as `finding-NN-<slug>.md` files containing Title, Severity, Affected Endpoint, Description, Reproduction Steps, Evidence, Impact, and a Verification section sourced from the verifier's reproduction notes.
